# nix-config

Personal nix-darwin/NixOS flake, structured with the **dendritic pattern**:
every file is a `flake-parts` module, and every file contributes to the flake
by *merging* into shared options rather than being manually imported/wired
together in a central place.

## How it's wired

`flake.nix` is a thin bootstrap:

```nix
imports = [
  inputs.flake-parts.flakeModules.modules  # gives us flake.modules.<class>.<name>
  (inputs.import-tree ./modules)           # auto-imports every .nix file under modules/
];
```

- `import-tree` walks `./modules` and imports **every** `.nix` file it finds
  as a flake-parts module. There is no manual list of imports to maintain —
  dropping a new file into `modules/` is enough to wire it in.
- `flake-parts.flakeModules.modules` declares the `flake.modules.<class>.<name>`
  option, which is the shared namespace all the feature files write into.

## The pattern: features as named modules

Each "feature" is its own file under `modules/features/`, and it declares
itself as an entry in `flake.modules.nixos.<name>`:

```nix
# modules/features/caddy.nix
{
  flake.modules.nixos.caddy = { pkgs, config, ... }: {
    services.caddy = { ... };
  };
}
```

This is just a plain NixOS module value living at
`flake.modules.nixos.caddy` — nothing imports it yet. Because these are
independent files that only *add* an attribute to a shared set, they compose
for free: any number of feature files can exist side by side with zero
coordination between them, and each one is independently readable/deletable.

Features that need their own options (e.g. disko layout, needing a
per-host disk path) define an `options.*` block and read it via `config` —
same as any NixOS module:

```nix
# modules/features/disko-gpt-lvm.nix
{
  flake.modules.nixos.diskoGptLvm = { config, lib, ... }: {
    options.diskoConfig.primaryDisk = lib.mkOption { type = lib.types.str; };
    config.disko.devices = { ... };  # uses config.diskoConfig.primaryDisk
  };
}
```

## Hosts: opting into features

A host is where features actually get pulled together. Each host under
`modules/hosts/<name>/` has:

- `configuration.nix` — builds `flake.nixosModules.<name>Configuration` by
  `imports`-ing the feature names it wants out of `self.modules.nixos`:

  ```nix
  # modules/hosts/telemachus/configuration.nix
  flake.nixosModules.telemachusConfiguration = { pkgs, lib, ... }: {
    imports = with self.modules.nixos; [
      telemachusHardware
      jellyfin
      immich
      diskoGptLvm
      nix-settings
    ];
    diskoConfig.primaryDisk = "/dev/nvme0n1";  # host-specific option values
    system.stateVersion = "24.05";
    # ... other host-specific settings
  };
  ```

- `default.nix` — turns that module into an actual
  `flake.nixosConfigurations.<name>` via `nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem`.
- `hardware-configuration.nix` — the standard generated hardware module,
  itself registered as a feature (`self.modules.nixos.<name>Hardware`) so it
  can be imported the same way as everything else.

So the flow per host is: **pick features by name → set host-specific option
values → build the system.** Adding a new feature to a host is a one-line
addition to that host's `imports` list; adding a brand new feature to the
repo is just a new file in `modules/features/` that nothing else has to
touch.

## Notes

- `old/` holds the pre-rewrite, non-dendritic config for reference during
  the migration — not part of the active flake.
- Prefer small, single-purpose feature files over grouping unrelated config
  together; the pattern's value comes from features being independently
  composable.
